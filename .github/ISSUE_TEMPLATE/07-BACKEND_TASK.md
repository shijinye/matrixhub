<!-- Defaults to a subtask of a parent (tracking) issue. To use as a standalone/normal issue, overwrite the feature section below with the actual details. -->

**What is the feature and Why is this needed**:

The feature is detailed in the parent issue.

**Dev requirements**:

- **Technical design**: for a simple change, describe the approach directly in the checklist; for a complex one, write a **technical design doc** (under `docs/design/`, or an external doc) and get maintainer review **before coding**; link it in the checklist.
- **Review the QA test cases** for this feature and leave **at least one constructive comment** on the QA task.
- Add **unit tests (UT)** for methods with complex or important logic, especially those under `internal/domain`.
- Add **E2E tests** for this feature.
- Document **API changes**: link the swagger contract (`api/openapiv2/v1alpha1/<service>.swagger.json`), then list each new/changed proto or HTTP API as its own sub-checkbox with a short note on what it does, and tick it once implemented so frontend and QA can see which APIs are ready; write **none** if not applicable.
